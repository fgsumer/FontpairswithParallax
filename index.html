          >Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having
          nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it
          had no pictures or conversations in it, 'and what is the use of a book,' thought Alice
          'without pictures or conversation?'</a

        'Curiouser and curiouser!' cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that for the moment she
        quite forgot how to speak good English); 'now I'm opening out like the largest telescope
        that ever was! Good-bye, feet!' (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be
        almost out of sight, they were getting so far off). 'Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who
        will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I'm sure I shan't be able! I shall
        be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you: you must manage the best way you
        can;—but I must be kind to them,' thought Alice, 'or perhaps they won't walk the way I want
        to go! Let me see: I'll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas.'

          feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross,
          and uncomfortable.

          >It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking anxiously about as it
          went, as if it had lost something; and she heard it muttering to itself 'The Duchess! The
          Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh my fur and whiskers! She'll get me executed, as sure as
          ferrets are ferrets! Where CAN I have dropped them, I wonder?' Alice guessed in a moment
          that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she very
          good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were nowhere to be seen—everything
          seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass
          table and the little door, had vanished completely.

          >For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what to do next, when
          suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the wood—(she considered him to be a
          footman because he was in livery: otherwise, judging by his face only, she would have
          called him a fish)—and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was opened by
          another footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a frog; and both
          footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all over their heads. She felt very
          curious to know what it was all about, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.

        The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence: at last the
        Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.
        'Who are YOU?' said the Caterpillar.

          Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the
          other two were using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its
          head. 'Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse,' thought Alice; 'only, as it's asleep, I
          suppose it doesn't mind.'</a

      <h3>The Queen's Croquet-Ground</h3>
      <p>
        A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses growing on it were white,
        but there were three gardeners at it, busily painting them red. Alice thought this a very
        curious thing, and she went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard
        one of them say, 'Look out now, Five! Don't go splashing paint over me like that!' 'I
        couldn't help it,' said Five, in a sulky tone; 'Seven jogged my elbow.'
